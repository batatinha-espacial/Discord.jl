Discord.jl is the solution for creating [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bots with the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org).

* Strong, expressive type system: No fast-and-loose JSON objects here.
* Non-blocking: API calls return immediately and can be awaited when necessary.
* Simple: Multiple dispatch allows for a [small, elegant core API](https://xh4h.github.io/Discord.jl/stable/rest.html#CRUD-API-1).
* Fast: Julia is [fast like C but still easy like Python](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia).
* Robust: Resistant to bad event handlers and/or requests. Errors are introspectible for debugging.
* Lightweight: Cache what is important but shed dead weight with [TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live).
* Gateway independent: Ability to interact with Discord's API without establishing a gateway connection.
* Distributed: [Process-based sharding](https://xh4h.github.io/Discord.jl/stable/client.html#Discord.Client) requires next to no intervention and you can even run shards on separate machines.

## Installation
First [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/). Make sure you are running the latest version.

Discord.jl is not yet released.
Add it from the Git repository with the following command:

```julia
# Enter ']' from the REPL to enter Pkg mode.
pkg> add https://github.com/Xh4H/Discord.jl
```
The above command will also update all of your dependencies, and store the
configurations in ~/.julia. 

## Example

```julia
# Import Discord.jl.
using Discord
# Create a client.
c = Client("token"; presence=(game=(name="with Discord.jl", type=AT_GAME),))

# Create a handler for the MessageCreate event.
function handler(c::Client, e::MessageCreate)
    # Display the message contents.
    println("Received message: $(e.message.content)")
    # Add a reaction to the message.
    create(c, Reaction, e.message, 'üëç')
end

# Add the handler.
add_handler!(c, MessageCreate, handler)
# Log in to the Discord gateway.
open(c)
# Wait for the client to disconnect.
wait(c)
```
